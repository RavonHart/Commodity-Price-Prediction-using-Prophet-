Title: Commodity Price Prediction using Prophet and FastAPI


Description:

This repository contains a comprehensive project for predicting the price trends of commodities using Facebook's Prophet model and deploying the predictions via a FastAPI web application.


The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can select a commodity, specify the date range, and receive price predictions in the form of visualized graphs and tabular data. The solution is designed to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions by leveraging time-series forecasting techniques.


Features:

Data Preparation: 

Preprocessing of historical commodity price data, including handling missing values and feature scaling.

Modeling: 

Implementation of Prophet for time-series forecasting to predict prices with high accuracy.

API Development: 

FastAPI-powered backend for serving predictions via RESTful endpoints.
User Interface: 

A simple and interactive interface for users to input commodity details and view forecasts.
Visualization:

Dynamic graph generation to showcase trends and predictions effectively.
Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks: FastAPI, Prophet

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Deployment: Can be containerized using Docker for scalable and portable deployment.

Setup Instructions:
